        <h2>About T-20 World Cup</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          T-20 World Cup is one of the three formats of cricket. As the name
          suggests, it is a 20-over match, and each bowler can bowl a maximum of
          4 overs. It was introduced by the ECB in 2003. Each team has one
          innings of 20 overs, making matches last about 3 hours. This format
          was made to attract a wider audience by shortening the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The format gained global popularity and is now played both
          internationally and domestically by all major cricket-playing nations.

          <h3>Origin</h3>
          <p>
            When the Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB wanted a format
            that could attract younger fans. Stuart Robertson proposed a
            20-over-per-side format, which counties approved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003. The
            format was a success, especially with high crowd attendance, like
            the Lord’s match in 2004 that drew over 27,000 people.

          <h3>Worldwide Spread</h3>
          <p>
            Pakistan held its first domestic T20 tournament in 2004. Australia
            followed in 2005 with a full-house crowd of 20,000. The West Indies
            launched the Stanford 20/20 in 2006, heavily backed by billionaire
            Allen Stanford.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2007, large crowds continued for domestic and international
            matches. Notably, over 85,000 fans attended the 2008 Australia vs
            India T20 match at the MCG.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Stanford Super Series featured high-stakes matches but ended in
            controversy when Allen Stanford was charged with fraud in 2009.
